<p align="center">A simple template to get started with <a href="https://github.com/nestjs/nest" target="_blank">Nest</a> which just meets my need. Feel free to fork and open a pull request if you would like to put something into in.</p>

## Description

This boilerplate aims to bring a simple nest application setup with all the support which a developer aims to get in an application to start. Please do note that this is just a reflection of how I like to have my application with all the utils and other things, If you know, you know.

I am not aiming yet to bring the test feature into this application since it varies in many cases, and you should write your test as per yourself. It's something important but yeah not yet on my To-Do. Sooner or later, it will be there anyway.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev
